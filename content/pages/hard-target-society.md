# The Hard Target Society

## More Than a One-Time Class

Looking for ongoing support and skill development? The Hard Target Society is our monthly membership community for women committed to continuous growth in safety, confidence, and empowerment.

## What You Get Each Month

### Monthly Training Sessions
Live, interactive training covering:
- Advanced self-protection techniques
- Situational awareness development
- Confidence and presence building
- Stress management and resilience
- Communication and boundary-setting

### Small Group Coaching
Intimate coaching circles where you get personalized attention and feedback. Work through real scenarios and challenges with expert guidance.

### Community Access
Connect with other strong women pursuing growth and empowerment. Share experiences, celebrate victories, and get support during challenging times.

### Exclusive Resources
Access to training materials, videos, audio guides, and continued education resources available only to Hard Target Society members.

### Monthly Q&A Sessions
Direct access to Autumn for your burning questions. Get personalized guidance on implementing what you've learned and navigating real-world situations.

## Membership Benefits

### Ongoing Skill Development
Continuous growth means continuous improvement. Build skills progressively rather than cramming everything into a single workshop.

### Personalized Coaching Attention
Small group settings mean you get individualized feedback and support tailored to your specific challenges and goals.

### Accountability & Community
Stay motivated with regular check-ins, goal-setting, and peer support from women on similar growth journeys.

### Flexible Learning
Skip traditional classroom constraints. Learn at your own pace while having regular touchpoints for guidance and course corrections.

### Cost-Effective Growth
Much more affordable than repeated individual classes or private coaching, while providing ongoing access to expert training.

## How It Works
