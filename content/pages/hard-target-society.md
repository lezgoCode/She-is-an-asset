## Self‑protection only works if *you work it.*

Learning something once is great — **but does it stick?**

Especially when chaos occurs, if you haven't practiced and made what you learned in class second nature...

***you could find yourself feeling more like the problem than the solution.***

### Next Live Training:

- **Tuesday September 23rd at 8pm**  
  **Topic:** Using Your Body as a weapon

### Have you ever wanted to learn how to fight/protect yourself — but don't have time to commit to going to a martial arts gym?

- Maybe you don't want to roll around with sweaty dudes—  
- Maybe you're like the majority of women and feel a little intimidated to join—  
- Or maybe you just don't know where to start?

## The Hard Target Society is an excellent starting point for *all of this.*

### Why This Exists:

*You left our training on fire.*  
*You remembered the moves.*  
*You stood taller.*  
*You felt powerful.*

But a few months later, you froze in a moment that mattered — because the moves were gone.  
*The confidence faded.*  
*Life got busy.*

***That's not your fault.***  
*That's how most personal safety trainings work: one moment, and then… nothing.*

*The Hard Target Society changes that.*  
*This is where you remember the moves without having to go to class.*  
*And it's where you build the muscle memory — in your body, in your voice, in your boundaries.*  
*But we don't do it alone.*  
*Because safety is personal…*  
*But resilience?*  
*That's built in community.*

## This is the bridge.

- Between that one class and long-term confidence
- Between learning the moves and living them
- Between feeling alone and being surrounded by women doing this work, too

**The Society is monthly support, practice, coaching, and connection — for women who want more than a one‑time moment.**

## This is your space to:

- Stay consistent with personal safety tools
- Feel grounded and powerful in your everyday life
- Ask questions, get coaching, and stay connected
- Be surrounded by a community of strong, smart women committed to walking tall together

**This is how we make the "aha" moment last.**  
**This is how we lead ourselves forward — together.**
