# Private Coaching with Autumn Schmidt

## One-on-One Transformation for Ambitious Women

Ready to stop second-guessing yourself and start leading with unshakeable confidence? My private coaching is for women who want personalized, deep transformation—not generic advice or surface-level tips.

## Who This Is For

### High-Achieving Professional Women
- Executives and senior leaders ready to amplify their impact
- Entrepreneurs scaling their business and their leadership
- Professionals transitioning into new roles or higher levels of responsibility
- Women who want to lead authentically while maintaining their humanity

### Women Seeking Personal Mastery
- Anyone tired of playing small or living in others' shadows
- Women navigating major life transitions (career changes, relationship shifts, new responsibilities)
- Those ready to heal trauma responses and show up powerfully in all relationships
- Women who want practical tools for confidence, boundaries, and authentic authority

## How We Work Together

### Deep Assessment & Strategy
We begin with comprehensive evaluation of your current strengths, challenges, goals, and patterns. No generic coaching—only strategies tailored to your specific situation, industry, and aspirations.

### Personalized Development Plan
Based on your unique needs, we create a customized coaching plan that addresses:
- Leadership presence and authority
- Communication and influence strategies
- Confidence and self-trust building
- Boundary-setting and relationship dynamics
- Stress management and resilience tools

### Bi-Weekly Intensive Sessions
Regular 90-minute deep-dive sessions focused on breakthrough moments, skill-building, and pattern recognition. These aren't check-ins—they're transformative experiences that create lasting change.

### Between-Session Support
Personalized resources, reflection exercises, and real-world implementation strategies. Plus unlimited email support for mid-week insights, questions, and breakthroughs.

## What You'll Transform

### Professional Presence
Learn to command respect and influence outcomes through body language, voice, and presence. Develop authentic authority that inspires trust and drives results.

### Leadership Confidence
Stop second-guessing your instincts and decisions. Build unshakeable self-trust and the courage to lead with clarity, even in uncertainty.

### Boundary Mastery
Create healthy boundaries that protect your energy while maintaining authentic relationships. Stop people-pleasing and start prioritizing your wellbeing and success.

### Relationship Dynamics
Transform how you show up in all relationships—professional, romantic, family, and friendships. Stop shrinking to accommodate others and start showing up as your full, authentic self.

### Stress and Resilience
Develop practical tools for handling pressure, setbacks, and high-stakes situations. Learn to maintain clarity and confidence even when everything feels chaotic.

## My Approach to Coaching

### Former Law Enforcement Perspective
My background in law enforcement gives me unique insight into decision-making under pressure, reading situations accurately, and maintaining authority in challenging circumstances.

### Trauma-Informed Methods
We honor how past experiences shape your patterns and responses. Healing happens alongside skill-building, creating authentic transformation from the inside out.

### Body-Based Learning
We don't just talk about confidence—we build it through embodied practices that help you access your power, presence, and authority in real situations.

### Real-World Application
Every session includes specific takeaways you can implement immediately in your work, relationships, and daily life.
