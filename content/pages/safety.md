# Safety Starts at Home. And Work.

> You can't always prevent chaos.  
> But you can be ready for it.

These 1:1 safety assessments help you understand your space—home or workplace—from a predator's perspective. Together, we build an action plan to make you, your loved ones, and your team harder targets.

Beyond a generic slate of google‑able guidance, you receive a tactical, judgment‑free walkthrough with real recommendations—plus the option to receive personalized, hands‑on training for what to do if the worst happens.

## Why It Works

> Because when it comes to safety, you don't rise to the occasion.  
> You fall to your level of preparation.

Let's raise that level—together.

You don't have to live in fear.  
You just have to stop living unprepared.
