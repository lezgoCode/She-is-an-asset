# Meet Autumn

Most people teach confidence from the neck up.  
I teach it from the ground up — body, voice, presence, and mindset.

I’m Autumn Schmidt — a former police officer turned trauma-informed empowerment trainer, personal safety coach, and speaker. I help women and high-stakes teams build confidence, calm, and leadership that actually shows up in the real world.

I founded She’s An Asset to teach women how to stop playing small, trust themselves, and move through life like they matter. Our trainings help women access personal leadership, situational awareness, and real tools to navigate stress, boundaries, and safety — without losing their softness, spirit, or truth.

I also lead You’re An Asset — corporate leadership trainings designed for teams, educators, client-facing industries, and anyone who works under pressure. This isn’t a lecture or a slideshow. It’s training that activates your people’s voice, body language, nervous system, and clarity — so they can lead effectively and feel grounded at work.

Private coaching with me is also open to a small number of women who are ready to stop second-guessing and start showing up with powerful clarity — in boardrooms, relationships, and everything in between.

Let’s talk if you’re ready to work together — or if your organization wants to train women and teams to show up differently.
