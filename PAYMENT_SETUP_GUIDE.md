## ðŸš€ How to Set Up Payments (3 Easy Options)

### Option 1: Stripe Payment Links (RECOMMENDED - Easiest!)

1. **Sign up for Stripe** (free): https://stripe.com
2. **Create Payment Links** in your Stripe Dashboard:
   - Go to Products â†’ Payment Links
   - Create a link for each product:
     - Hard Target Society Monthly: $19/month (recurring)
     - Hard Target Society 6-Month: $95 (one-time)
     - Power Session: $297 (one-time)
     - Ongoing Coaching: $495/month (recurring)
     - Safety Assessment: $475 (one-time)
     - Business Assessment: $875 (one-time)
     - Women's Event: $75 (one-time)

3. **Update the links** in `simple-payment.html`:
   - Replace `https://buy.stripe.com/test_1234567890` with your actual Stripe Payment Links
   - Find the section with `stripeLink:` and update each one

### Option 2: PayPal (Also Easy!)

1. **Set up PayPal Business** account
2. **Create PayPal.Me links** for each amount:
   - https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/shesanasset/19
   - https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/shesanasset/95
   - etc.

3. **Update the links** in `simple-payment.html`:
   - Replace the `paypalLink:` URLs with your actual PayPal links

### Option 3: Manual Payments (Backup)

The system already includes a "Contact for Payment" option that automatically emails you with the customer's request. This works immediately!

## ðŸ”§ Quick Setup Steps

1. **Choose your payment method** (Stripe recommended)
2. **Sign up for the service** (Stripe/PayPal)
3. **Create payment links** for each product
4. **Update the links** in `simple-payment.html`
5. **Test with small amounts** first

## ðŸ“§ What Happens When Someone Pays?

- **Manual Payment**: Customer clicks "Contact for Payment" â†’ You get email with their request â†’ You send them payment instructions
